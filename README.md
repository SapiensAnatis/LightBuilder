## LightBuilder ##

Just Cause 2 Multiplayer Mod Lua script, which allows for user placement of persistent lights.

#### Requirements

A screen width of at least 1000 pixels is recommended to view the GUI portion of this script effectively, as well as a standard European/American QWERTY keyboard for the following information to be relevant and the controls to be comfortable.

#### Info for server owners

Lights are fully synced and are listed in the GUI with radius, name, and the Steam name of the creator. *Due to the fact that names are freely changeable (especially with the --name launch argument of JCMP) it is not recommended to expose this script's functionality to all players, as they can easily abuse it and leave no trace.*

The selected light is denoted with an axes, origin of the light's given Vector3 position, where red is the X direction and green is the Y direction, leaving blue as the Z direction.

Lights are fully persistent between server restarts by the way of loading in a text file in the base script folder, called SaveFile.txt. If this file is not present it will be created at first launch. 
When the script writes to this file, it will save the contents from the last version of the file to another file called SaveFile.txt.backup. This is not a comprehensive backup system and is not designed to contain any content older than one restart.

### Usage

Press L to open the GUI itself. From there you may create lights and view existing ones, in the two tabs of the window.

Creating a light is fairly simple - but moving them requires some more control. To move a light, first select it in the list on the Existing Lights tab. To move on two axes, use the arrow keys. This will allow you to achieve +/- on a flat plane. To move up and down use PgUp and PgDown. *All light movements are relative to the game world, not the player.*


To clone, use the Insert key (this can be either the Ins key in the bundle of six keys to the left of the Enter & Backspace keys, or just numpad 0 with numlock off). You will then be asked what to name the new clone.

To delete a light, you must tick the box titled "Toggle Deletion Mode" in the Existing Lights tab. Then, with any light selected by clicking on it on the list, right click to delete your selected light.

So long as a light is selected, you are free to move it, clone it, and delete it (with tickbox checked) with or without the GUI open, using these controls.

*Note: press the Del key to deselect a light.*
